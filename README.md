# irix-dotfiles
I have done many terrible things to my 4D Irix Interactive Desktop. Lets share!

The fantastic IMD-Evo theme is from here: https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1420871/
The bubble theme I use only for in-app GTK icons, from here https://store.kde.org/p/1531940/
XMMS skins come from WinAmp, good collection here https://skins.webamp.org/
They go into /usr/sgug/share/xmms/Skins/
