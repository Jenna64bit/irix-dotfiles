# irix-dotfiles
I have done many terrible things to my 4D Irix Interactive Desktop. Lets share!

* The fantastic IMD-Evo theme is from here: https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1420871/
* The bubble theme I use only for in-app GTK icons, from here https://store.kde.org/p/1531940/
* XMMS skins come from WinAmp, good collection here https://skins.webamp.org/ They go into /usr/sgug/share/xmms/Skins/

Some useful tidbits:
* Preterhuman! I adapted the synergy setup here for my Barrier port https://wiki.preterhuman.net/Use_Custom_Background_on_Irix
* More neat tips, including changing window framing http://www.fsck.it/html/geek/tips/look.html
* Rad IRIX backdrops https://forums.sgi.sh/index.php?threads/create-your-own-irix-desktop-backgrounds-and-post-them-here-for-others-to-download.503/
